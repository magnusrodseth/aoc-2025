/// Module containing all daily Advent of Code solutions
///
/// Each day's solution is in its own module file (day01.rs, day02.rs, etc.)
/// and follows the same structure:
///
/// - Public `part1()` and `part2()` functions that solve each part
/// - Public `run()` function that reads input and prints results
/// - Comprehensive tests based on puzzle examples
/// - Helper functions for parsing and solving

pub mod day01;

// Uncomment as more days are implemented
// pub mod day02;
// pub mod day03;
// ... and so on
